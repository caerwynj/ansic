A large part of pf9 is based on plan9port with only minor
modifications. This includes the source files within the directories

	include, src/lib*, src/cmd

the scripts 9a, 9c, 9l in linux/bin 9.rc, doctype, man, lookman, lc and
psfonts in rc/bin, and some yacc/lex support files in lib.

For plan9port (mostly), and additional files distributed with pf9,
the Lucent Public License, v1.02, applies, please see
LICENSE.plan9port for details.

Some code has been derived from Inferno utilities sources
(utils/rcsh/Nt.c, dirstat-Nt.c), other ideas have been taken
from 9pm.

Devdraw.exe for MinGW has been derived from drawterm, adapted
to plan9port's devdraw structure.

---------------------------------------------------

The mkfile-hierarchy is based on files from Plan 9, i.e. the files

	src/mk*

are copies of the original Plan 9 files, some with slight modifications
and some additions from plan9port.


---------------------------------------------------

Two scripts, todos and fromdos, written by Russ Cox, have been
copied from the contrib directory of the Plan 9 system:

(The rely on ed, whose port is broken again, unfortunately.)
